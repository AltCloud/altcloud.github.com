This All-In-One Web & App Solution uses some of the most sophisticated technologies out there. Normally, you'd pay for a framework this powerful.\r\n\r\n### OpenERP\r\nNot only Instance3 is developed by AltCloud Open. We've also developed several OpenERP extensions, but besides these, we've created the OERPHP library, which allows you to connect to & manipulate OpenERP Instances & DBs  from regular PHP scripts, just like you are working with A regular database.","note":"Don't delete this file!
