        <h3>Welcome to AltCloud Open</h3>

<p>AltCloud Open is a division of the AltCloud Design &amp; Hosting Company, responsible for maintenance and improvement of the open source software (parts) created by AltCloud and it's Devs.</p>

<p>AltCloud Open is responsible for several open projects, but most of our time &amp; effort goes into the Instance Content Management Framework, a top-of-the-line Content Management System, Rendering Engine &amp; App Builder in one.</p>

<h3>Instance3</h3>

<p>Instance 3 is our primary project, used to power hundreds of sites &amp; apps. This All-In-One Web &amp; App Solution uses some of the most sophisticated technologies out there. Normally, you'd pay for a framework this powerful.</p>

<h3>OpenERP</h3>

<p>Not only Instance3 is developed by AltCloud Open. We've also developed several OpenERP extensions, but besides these, we've created the OERPHP library, which allows you to connect to &amp; manipulate OpenERP Instances &amp; DBs  from regular PHP scripts, just like you are working with A regular database.</p>
